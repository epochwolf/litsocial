<%# 
My dearest Sass,

I love you but you don't support importing entire folders of less files. This is very 
inconvenient for me since I like to use folders as namespaces. This has forced me to use 
erb in my assets folder which is something I've tried very hard to avoid. You see, my 
text editor has a passion hatred for erb sprinkled in abitrary files. The highlighting 
decided to make the entire file green because there is a single erb tag in my less. 
Before you tell me to switch to an editor with better support let me inform you I love 
my editor more than you. I know it's not polite to mention I love another in this 
letter but you need to know where you stand. Rather than have a fling with a better 
language, I'll instead give you want you want. I'll use erb to list each file seperate,
just the way to like it. I do this not because I condone your absolutely tragic lack 
of functionality but because I love you just enough to not dump you.

<% Dir.glob(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "site/*.css.scss")).each do |sass_file| %>
  @import "site/<%=File.basename sass_file %>";
<% end %>

With my deepest love,
Epoch

P.S. If you actually support importing folders, update your documentation to show that.
